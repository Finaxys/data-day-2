# FINAXYS DATA DAY #2

## Introduction

In this workshop, you are working in a Financial reporting team in a well known Asset Manager.

You are requested to produce ESG performance tracking spreadsheets integrating all the funds of your Asset Manager.

Those spreadsheets leverage data from your Asset Manager _infocentre_.

This task is error-prone, time-consuming and with very little added value.

Thus, you want to industrialize the process and give your clients direct access to your data.
